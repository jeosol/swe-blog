## Objective
-- Describe the reservoir simulation model (and economic model) that we will use for waterflood
performance evaluation of our cross-section.


## Introduction ##

In this post, we will briefly describe the simulation model that we will use for
the waterflood performance evaluation in the cross-section. 

The reservoir simulation model described here will represent a base case. We will make adjustments to this base
case model (e.g., the change the KvKh ratio, tilt the reservoir, etc.) to illustrate the
effect of different factors (e.g., vertical communication, gravity, etc.) on the
waterflood performance. 

## Simulation Model 

A simple cross-section (X-Z) reservoir simulation model is used to describe
fluid flow in the reservoir cross-section. The simulation model is constructed
mainly using the cross-section reservoir properties (e.g., permeability,
porosity, initial water saturation). We have made assumptions for the other parameters
required in the simulation model (e.g., relative permeability curves, well
data, well controls, fluid and rock-fluid properties). These assumptions will
be described later. 

### Cross-section Data
The cross-section data contains 20 layers. Relevant rock/rock-fluid properties, e.g., layer
thickness, permeability, porosity and initial water saturation
vary for each layer. Figure 1 shows the permeability vs. depth profile of the
cross-section data.

    vs. depth for the cross-section.</p>
        </div>

</div>

### Simulation Grid

The simulation grid contains 20 layers, each layer corresponding to the layer
in the cross-section.


For our base case simulation model, we will assume a simulation grid of
100 x 1 x 20 cells. The
dimension of each grid cell in the X-direction is **100ft** and for
the Y-direction, it is **500ft**. The thickness (height) of each grid cell varies and
is equal to the thickness of the corresponding layer in the
cross-section. The dimension of the simulation grid is **10,000ft** by **500ft** by
**439ft** (this is the sum of all layer heights). 

Figure 2 shows the
simulation grid with the X-direction permeability property displayed. The
highest permeabilities (approximately 900md) are found in layers 9 and 10 indicated by the red
color.

    <div class="row">

            class="img-responsive"/>

    X-direction permeability values (md).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

The base case simulation model is horizontal. In later series, we will tilt the reservoir to investigate gravity effects. 

### Relative Permeability
The cross-section data contains different initial water saturation (Swi)
values for each
layer. We have assumed that the oil phase makes up the rest of the saturation,
i.e., Soi = 1- Swi. As a result, our simulation model will contain only two
phases, oil and water. 

Corey relative permeability model was used to generate a base relative
permeability curve. This base curve is then end-point adjusted for each layer
to obtain the relative permeability curve for each layer. The adjustment
ensures that the water phase is initially immobile in each layer. The
relative permeability curves for the 20 layers is shown in Figure 3.

### Wells
We assume that all wells are simple, fully-penetrating vertical wells, i.e.,
the wells are completed in all the layers of the simulation model. Also, the well control
type and control values specified for each well remains constant throughout the
production period. 

For the simulations, we will assume reservoir voidage
controls for simplicity, and the total reservoir injection rate from the
injector(s) is set equal to the total reservoir voidage rate from the producer.

#### Waterflooding well configuration

The base simulation model contains only two wells, a water injection well (injector) and an
oil production well (producer).

Figure 3 shows the well configuration for waterflooding the cross-section. In
Figure 3, L = 10,000 ft, W = 500 ft and H = 439 ft as described in the
simulation grid section. The
injector is located at the left end of the simulation model, completed in grid
blocks (1,1,1-20), and the producer at the right end of the model and
completed in grid blocks (100,1,1-20). 

<div class="front-container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="figure">
            <img
            src="/assets/petroleum/posts/tutorials/evaluate-waterflood-simulation/base_well_schematic.png"
            class="img-responsive"/>
            <p class="figure-caption">Figure 3: Well configuration for
            waterflooding. </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


Water is injected from the surface (indicated by blue
arrow(s)) into the reservoir (via the injector's wellbore). Water in the
reservoir then displaces the oil phase (indicated by green arrows) towards the
producer. Fluids in the producer the flows subsequently to the surface. In the
case, water is normally referred to as the
**displacing** phase and oil as the **displaced** phase.

The fluids produced in
the producer depends on the stage of the waterflood. Before water
breakthrough (i.e., when the injected water reaches the producer), only oil is
produced in the producer. After water breakthrough (injected water has reached the producer),
both oil and water are produced with the oil rate decreasing and the water
rate increasing with time. 


## Production Schedule
We have assumed a total production time of 15 years in the base model. As
described earlier, the well controls are fixed and constant throughout the production period. Later, 
we will remove this limitation and allow the well control to vary within fixed time intervals. 

## Economic model 

We will use an economic model to evaluate different production scenarios,
e.g., primary depletion, waterflooding. We will use a simple economic
model to compute net present value (NPV). NPV is an important economic criterion
for evaluating and comparing different projects. Projects with higher NPV
values are (generally) better. There are other important economic indicators,
e.g., discounted cash flow rate of return (ROR/DCFROR), development cost, Pay
out time, etc. However for simplicity, we will focus more on NPV and Pay out
time. 

The economic model accounts for well drilling and
completion costs, royalty rate, tax rate, and operating expense related to
production and injection of oil and water phases. The parameter values assumed
in the economic model are shown in Table 1.

    <tr>
        <td> Tax rate </td> <td> 40% </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of the series, we will assume these economic parameters for
computing NPV. In addition, we will assume that operating expenses and prices are fixed
throughout the production period. 

All wells are pre-drilled and are fully operational prior to start of
production. Hence, the well drilling and
completion costs are incurred in the first year of production. 

## Simulation Model Assumptions

Assumptions in the base simulation model include:

-  all grid cells have a net-to-gross of 1.0.

-  all grid cells in the model are active.

-  rock properties (PERMX, PERMY, PERMZ, PORO, ...) are constant for each layer.

-  each grid cell's X-direction permeability (PERMX) is set equal to corresponding
   layer value from the cross-section. Porosity and initial water saturation
   are defined similarly.

-  permeability in the X (PERMX) and Y (PERMY) directions are equal, while the permeability in
   the Z-direction (PERMZ) is 10% of PERMX.
   
-  relative permeability curves generated using Corey model, then end-point
   adjusted for each layer.

-  dead oil PVT model, i.e., no gas is dissolved in the oil phase. There is no
   gas in the simulation model.

-  no artificial lift curves and hence pressure losses in the tubing are not
   modeled.

-  constant well controls throughout production period.


## Conclusion ##

In this post, we have described the (base) simulation model that we will use
for the waterflood performance evaluation of the cross-section. The description is at a high-level
and does not include details of the simulation deck. We have chosen this approach
because there are different reservoir simulators with different requirements,
file formats/layouts, and also not to burden non reservoir engineers with too
much technical details. However, if there is enough interest, we will
make a separate post showing how the different components are put together to
obtain the simulation deck. 

While the simulation model can be built by hand, we use an automatic
workflow tool for generating (and running) the simulation models. There are many
simulation cases (hence simulation models) that we will consider in the tutorial series,
so it will be too time consuming to build each simulation model, submit the
simulations, and post-process the results manually. These tasks (and others) are performed
automatically by the tool. 

## What's Next
Now, that we have described the simulation model, we can start making some runs. First,
we will justify waterflooding in our cross-section. In our next post, we will compare the
benefits of waterflooding vs. primary depletion. We will use
cumulative oil produced (COP) and net present value as metrics for our comparisons.
